"""Dictionary

Dictionaries are Pythonâ€™s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. 
A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value

Dictionary is mutable and unordered. It can be nested and can contain mixed of datatypes

You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). 
A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value.

A Dictionary can be declared in following way

adict = {
    k1: v1, 
    k2: v2, 
    k3: v3
}

Declare an empty dictionary :

adict = {}

You can also construct a dictionary with the built-in dict() function. 

The argument to dict() should be a sequence of key-value pairs. 

We can create a dictionary from list of tuples as follows

adict = dict({
    (k1, v1),
    (k2, v2),
    (k3, v3)
}) 

if keys are simple strings you can also create a dictionary in following way

adict = dict(
    nilanjan='36',
    anupam='35'
)
